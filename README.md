A fluid simulator written in Python.

To run the simulator, run the [fluid\_sim.py](fluid\_sim.py) file. You need to have NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib installed.

I followed the method described in Jos Stam's paper: [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf).

Sample output:
